# Boilerplate Project Clean Architecture & CQRS
This is a boilerplate project to show Domain Driven Design (DDD), CQRS and clean architecture in a simple setup.

This solution uses the following technologies:
* [Dapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper/) to access the database
* [MediatR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MediatR/) to dispatch commands and queries
* [FluentValidation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentValidation/) to ensure validation rules
* [EnsureThat](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EnsureThatCore/) to create guard clauses

## About the Project
CentiSoft is a small company that builds a CRM system and sells it to their customers.
